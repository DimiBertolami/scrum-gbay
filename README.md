## Post-Mortem
after reviewing the past two weeks there's indeed some  things that could be improved.
merging conflicts went wrong a few times, also pushing every single insignificant file inside the
repository (node packages, .env file and package.jsons were here and
there manually modified which led to giant issues in the shared repository)
overwriting each others changes happened more than I care to admit.(path added to .env.config, removed again, added again, removed again,...
Something positive to mention about working in this team, is even though we got frustrated by the lack of progress
or by the type of "echternacht procession" where we take two steps forward and one step bacwards..
even though this happened alot, we managed to keep the atmosphere light in the group and remained
respectful for the opinions of our team members, which is in my opinion a crucial skill required for this type of job.
