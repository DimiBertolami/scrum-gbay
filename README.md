## Post-Mortem

- There were many difficulties that we encountered.
- Things that I found easy were difficult to other team members & difficult to communicate, & vice-versa.
- I'm atrocious at working with other people.
- Giving out tasks that I believed would take 1 hour generally took a lot longer.
- I can't do any learning when there is 8 hours every day of chatter.
- Getting everybody working with github correctly was impossible, we all lacked the fundamental skills for that & didn't really improve even towards the end.
- There was mass confusion about the .env file & .gitignore from the team.
- The initial planning on Jira was nowhere near a real-world case.
- Node.JS & Express are things I really need to look at in greater depth.
- Dependencies were messed up many times from lack of understanding.
- A lot of time was wasted looking at the same issues for each team member to get them up to speed - some of that was subsequently ignored which really pissed me off at times.
- I hate working with others.
- The hot weather didn't make things better.
